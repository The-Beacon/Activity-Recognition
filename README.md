# Activity-Recognition
This Project is Vision-Based Activity Recognition targets to learn how to detect a human body from a video and describe the activity of the Human using Computer Vision method such as HOG (Histogram of Gradients) and HOF (Histogram of Optical Flow) descriptors to Extract Features and use Machine-Learning Technique SVM(Support Vector Machine) and KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) Classifier to Classify and Recognition the human activity
